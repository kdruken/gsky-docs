Overview
========

GSKY is a distributed geospatial data server exposing OGC services developed at the NCI.

**In a few lines**

GSKY is designed to:

  * **Scale**: Distributed solution that scales in serving large volume of data for concurrent user access
  * **Work with raw data**: Transparent ingestion of geospatial collections in many scientific data formats such as NetCDF, HDF or geoTIFF
  * **Compute on-the-fly**: No need to precompute products. Resampling and reprojection happen on-the-fly in real time
  * **Standards**:  Implements OGC standards such as WMS, WCS and WPS
  * More functionalities to come....
