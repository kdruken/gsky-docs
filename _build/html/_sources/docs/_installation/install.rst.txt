Installation
************

These installation instructions build a GSKY  environment that can be used to ingest data (with config files from github) and run analytics processes.

Dependencies:

  * GDAL > 2.1.0
  * Go > 1.6.0
  * Various Go packages (handled by the build system)

These dependencies along with the target operating system environment should be considered when deciding how to install GSKY to meet your system requirements.

The recommended method for installing the GSKY is to use a container and package manager. The instructions below are for Miniconda and PostgreSQL.

Other methods to build and install GSKY are maintained by the community and are available at https://github.com/nci/gsky/. These may include docker recipes and operating system specific deployments.
